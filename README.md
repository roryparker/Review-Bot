# Warning - Just let others know

A social network that uses a review and messaging system to provide details on professional and personal behavior. This leads to increased integrity inside and outside of work, while avoiding enviroments that are the opposite.This network receives honest reviews from others in your professional and personal life. Reviews are seperated across two sections - 

* Work Life
* Personal Life 


Then placed into 3 app categories with self-explantory names.

Employr -

* Employr aims to warn prospective employees about toxic workplaces. For far too long companies have kept workplace activities enclosed. We would only learn about these actions if someone talked

Koworkr -

* Koworkr aims to stop workplace abuse by embbeding itself into the framework of prospective employees, current employees, and Human Resources.

Annoying - 

* Annoying aims to reduce exposure to terrible professional and personal relationships. These reviews come from verified eye witness accounts. 


I am using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and some ReactJS elements. I am also setting up the app to use System Desgin principals that I have gone over.

# My Awesome Project
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
