# The Truth - The Social Network that doesn't lie.

This is a Social Network based on honest reviews of people and companies from other people.
* Employee Life
* Personal Life 

Social Media has allowed people to become hypocritical in certain aspects of relationships. They represent one thing online, while stating another offline. It's wrong. 

Lying has become a serious problem in society. This aims to kill it.

How it works - 

"The Truth" is sperated into 3 app categories with self-explantory names.

Employr -

* Employr aims to warn prospective employees about toxic workplaces. For far too long companies have kept workplace activities enclosed. We would only learn about these actions if someone talked

Koworkr -

* Koworkr aims to stop workplace abuse by embbeding itself into the framework of prospective employees, current employees, and Human Resources.

Asshole - 

* Asshole aims to help others stay away from dregs and losers (men and women) in our society. These reviews come from verified eye witness accounts. 

Who are symptoms of dregs and losers?
* Inconsistent.
* They lie.
* Constantly drag you down.
* They cost you money.
* They are always broke.
* They are toxic.
* They are a liability. (They don't make you happy, healthy, or wealthy)


I used HTML, CSS, React, Javascript, and System Desgin principals using Amazon AWS to create this  reviews
